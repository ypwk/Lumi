## ImGUI Testing Frontend

A quick and dirty Dear ImGUI testing frontend is included in this repository under the `imgui-frontend` directory. This frontend uses [`GLFW`](https://github.com/glfw/glfw) and [`cURL`](https://github.com/curl/curl), which are linked as git submodules. Before compiling this with CMake, run the `buildconf.bat` file in the cURL subdirectory, at `imgui-frontend/external/curl`.

## React Native Frontend

To get microphone input on an Android emulator, run the following:

```
adb emu avd hostmicon
```

If you installed adb in the default location, run this:

```
C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\platform-tools\adb.exe emu avd hostmicon
```
